# Sample PHP project

This project shows my approach to building PHP applications. It is definitely not production-ready software. I mostly use Symfony and Laravel for my production software.

This project was built from scratch in 5 hours. Â Every PHP framework does similar things. This project shows how those great things could come together to form a more complex system.
